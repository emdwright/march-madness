## March Madness Prediction

Using a model built from historical, season level stats to help me fill out my bracket for the 2019 tournament. 

### About the Data

The data is made of two parts:

- Season level stats, for NCAA teams from 1995 to 2019. This is scraped from sports-reference.com

- Tournament-game data from 1995 to 2019. This is from [mmclaughlin87][1] github repository for the years 1995 to 2018. For 2017 and 2018, I dug further into the original source in [this pdf][2]
